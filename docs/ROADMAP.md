# Garmin Local Archive — Roadmap

> This is a hobby project built and maintained by one person without a programming background.  
> There are no deadlines, no guarantees, and no support obligations — development happens when it happens, and it may take a while.  
> Features get built when they get built.

## Planned — v1.5

### v1.5 — Archive Integrity & Backup

Protection of the local archive against software errors and silent data loss — independent of OS-level backup.

**`quality_log.json`**

- **Monthly backup** — `_save_quality_log()` creates a snapshot once per month as `quality_log_YYYY-MM.zip` in `log/backup/`. On the first save of a new year, the previous year is consolidated into `quality_log_YYYY.zip` and all monthly zips for that year are removed.
- **Per-year checksums** — on every save, a SHA-256 hash is computed over all `days` entries for each calendar year and stored in a `checksums` block inside `quality_log.json`. On load, all completed years are verified — a mismatch triggers a warning in the log and GUI indicating which year is affected and where the backup is located.

**`raw/`** — incremental backup of newly written files. Motivation: Garmin degrades intraday data in stages (full resolution → reduced → summaries only), with the high-resolution window covering only the most recent ~6 months — the local raw copy is then the only source. A software bug in the writer that overwrites or corrupts a raw file is not recoverable without a backup. This is a direct extension of the data erosion protection that is a core promise of this project.

- Ownership: writer or a dedicated backup module — to be evaluated
- Strategy: incremental, newly written files only
- Scope and implementation to be defined after v1.4 is stable

**Mirror Backup (manual)** — a button in the GUI copies the full archive to a second location configured once in Settings (path, optional — leaving it empty disables the feature). On each run: destination is compared against source (filename + size), missing files are copied over. Follows the same manual trigger pattern as Sync Garmin and Sync Context — no automatic execution. Target location can be a NAS, external drive, or any local path. If the destination is unreachable, the operation logs a clear warning and exits cleanly.

### v1.5.1 — Content Validation

Value range checks implemented in v1.4.3 (`garmin_validator`, `garmin_collector` downgrade logic). Remaining scope: dashboard integration of flagged days, flagged day markers in charts, outlier visualization.

---

## Planned — v1.6

- **Garmin FIT Pipeline & Plugin Architecture**
  The existing Garmin Health pipeline is being rebuilt into a plugin model — `garmin_map.py` → `garmin_health_map.py`, new `garmin_fit_map.py` as a second Garmin source (activity data via API + bulk import). `field_map.py` is being extended to become a source-agnostic broker. Goal: both Garmin sources run as equal pipelines side by side.

  *Pre-conditions (resolved before plugin work begins):*
  - `garmin_normalizer.py` — add real transformation layer; current pass-through insufficient once two sources deliver differing raw schemas
  - `run_import()` — narrow QUALITY_LOCK scope; currently held across entire bulk loop including file writes

---

### Sync Mode "auto" — Deprecation Candidate

Sync mode `auto` fetches the complete history from `first_day` to yesterday
via the Garmin API. It was the original solution for building a full archive
before Bulk Import existed.

With the current toolset this use case is fully covered:

| Task | Tool |
|---|---|
| Complete history | Bulk Import — faster, no 429 risk |
| Gap repair | Background Timer |
| Daily updates | Daily Sync (v1.4.5) |

`auto` is no longer the recommended path for any standard workflow. It
remains functional but is not actively promoted. Removal or explicit
deprecation notice to be evaluated — not a priority while the mode causes
no active harm.

---

## Planned — v1.7

### v1.7 — Dashboard Render Registry

The dashboard render layer currently dispatches layout types via an `if/elif`
block in `dash_plotter_html_complex.py`. Every new dashboard requires a direct
edit to this file — the plotter grows as a side effect of new specialists, not
by its own logic.

v1.7 replaces this with a render registry: each specialist declares its render
function alongside its `META` and `build()`. `dash_plotter_html_complex.py`
becomes a pure dispatcher — it routes to the registered renderer without
knowing anything about layout-specific logic.

**What changes:**
- `dash_plotter_html_complex.py` — dispatch by registry lookup, not `if/elif`
- Each `*_dash.py` specialist — declares a `render()` function or a
  `RENDERER` reference alongside `META` and `build()`
- Adding a new dashboard no longer requires touching the plotter

**What does not change:**
- The neutral dict contract between specialist and plotter remains identical
- `dash_runner.py` — no changes; it calls `plotter.render()` as before
- Existing specialists — migrated mechanically, no logic changes

**Motivation:** v1.6 introduces a second Garmin source; v2.0 adds external
sources (Strava, Komoot). Each will bring new dashboard layouts. A growing
`if/elif` chain is not a sustainable dispatch pattern at that scale.
The registry closes this before v2.0 begins.

**Pre-condition:** `dash_plotter_html_complex.py` internal restructuring
(v1.4.8 pipeline hardening) must be complete — layout paths cleanly separated
before the registry is introduced.

---

## Under consideration — v2.0

These are ideas, not commitments. Some may never get built.

**`context_validator.py` — Context Pipeline Validation**

Structural validation of context archive files at read time — analogous to
`garmin_validator.py` for the Garmin pipeline. Would detect missing fields,
wrong types, or corrupt JSON in `context_data/` before `context_map.py`
passes data to dashboard specialists.

Not needed while context data is written exclusively by `context_writer.py`
under full project control. Becomes relevant when additional external sources
(SILAM, other APIs) are added — external API responses are structurally
unpredictable in the same way Garmin API responses are.

Prerequisite: v2.0 multi-source architecture stable.
Natural companion to `context_dataformat.json` (schema definition, analogous
to `garmin_dataformat.json`).

---

**Multi-Source Architecture**

Extension to support multiple data sources (Strava, Komoot, ...) alongside Garmin. Full concept in `CONCEPT_V2-0.md`.

**Directory structure:** Each source gets its own isolated folder (`garmin_data/`, `strava_data/`, ...) with its own `raw/`, `summary/`, `log/`. A central `master/master_index.json` serves as a pure routing layer — which sources have data for a given day, and where. No logic, no decisions.

**Architecture principle — plugin modules:** Global actors (`writer`, `normalizer`, `sync`, `security`) remain source-agnostic. Each source provides a `*_master.py` plugin that delivers source-specific details on demand — paths, formats, validation rules, token location. Adding a new source means writing a new plugin and its source-specific actors (`*_api.py`, `*_quality.py`). All global actors work without modification.

**Translation layer:** `field_map.py` is the single point of truth for mapping fields between sources and the common schema. Dashboard and export scripts have no knowledge of source details — they only query `field_map`. Adding a new source means extending `field_map` — all scripts work automatically.

---

**Multiple User accounts**
Currently one account per Windows user. Switching between accounts requires manually changing credentials in Settings. Multi-account support would allow profiles per user.

**External factors & correlations**
Import external data (weather, activity logs, custom notes) and correlate with health metrics. Did poor sleep correlate with high stress? Did training load predict HRV drops?

**Adaptive Baselines**
Extend the Analysis Dashboard beyond fixed 90-day baselines. Rolling windows (7-day, 30-day), seasonal patterns, and load vs. recovery phase detection. The raw data is already there — this is purely an analytical layer on top of `garmin_analysis_html.py`.

**AI health report PDF**
Generate a formatted PDF health summary using the local AI model — personal baseline, flagged days, trends. Fully local, no cloud.

**Route heatmap**
Generate a local heatmap of GPS routes from activity data. No third-party mapping services.

**Windows notifications**
Toast notifications for sync completion, failed days, or significant metric changes.

**Stats dashboard & session log analysis**
Local overview of archive health built from session logs — days synced vs failed over time, which API endpoints fail most often, Garmin API response patterns by time of day. Builds on the Archive Info Panel (v1.3.1) and the quality data in `quality_log.json`. No extra API calls needed.

**Activities dashboard**
Training load, activity volume and sport-specific metrics (swim/bike/run) visualised over time. Activity data is already collected — it just isn't used beyond the summary.

**Test suite & CI/CD**
Core pipeline is covered by five test suites (218 + 134 + 211 + 80 checks + 8 sections for build output). Build integrity is covered by `validate_scripts()` in both build scripts and `test_build_output.py` as post-build gate. Full CI/CD with GitHub Actions for automated builds and release packaging is intentionally deferred — no timeline, no commitment, but the intention is there.

## Not planned

> These items are explicitly out of scope for v1.x but may be revisited for v2.0. No timeline, no commitment — but the intention is there.

- Cloud sync or remote access
- Mobile app
- Automatic data sharing, cloud sync, or social comparison features
- GUI and EXE are Windows-only and will remain so. The collector scripts work on Linux and macOS but are untested and unsupported — use at your own risk.
- Code signing or automatic updates
